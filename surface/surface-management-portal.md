# Surface Management Portal overview

Built into Microsoft Endpoint Manager, the new Surface Management Portal provides a centralized solution to self-serve, manage and monitor Surface devices at scale.

## Introduction

As a single environment for the end-to-end visibility of corporate or user-owned Surface devices, the Surface Management Portal lets you quickly see any issues that need prompt attention before they hit your help desk.

Get insights into device compliance, support activity, and warranty coverage. Quickly see the status of each device, which ones are still in warranty or expiring soon, and the status of active support requests with your hardware providers.

When your Surface devices are enrolled for cloud management and users log in for the first time, information from these Surface devices automatically flows into the Surface Management Portal, giving you a single pane of glass for Surface-specific device admin activities.

## Monitor Surface devices

Select **Monitor** to display insights for all your Surface devices, including:

- Devices out of compliance, which could mean users can’t access information requiring Azure AD login.
- Devices that aren’t registered.
- Devices with critically low storage available on disk, a leading indicator of potential user experience issues.
- Devices requiring updates.
- Devices without drive encryption enabled.
- Devices that are currently inactive.

Select **View report** to see details on each insights category, giving you diagnostic information that you can customize and export.

## Device warranty and coverage

if you manage hundreds or thousands of devices, having direct access to the warranty status of each device is especially useful, letting you quickly see the following information:

- Devices within the warranty period
- Devices expiring
- Devices out of warranty
- Devices eligible for optional coverage

## Support requests

The Surface Management Portal gives complete visibility into support activity along with the status of each request.
