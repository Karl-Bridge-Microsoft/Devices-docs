# Surface self-serve warranty and service

Microsoft 365 Business customers may be eligible to use the Surface Self-Serve Warranty and Service node in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center to create and manage service orders. This new feature, available as a beta program, allows Global Admins to designate permissions to individuals within their company responsible for supporting warranty and service claims, including:

- Upload serial numbers for the devices requiring service.
- Add multiple shipping addresses.
- Create a single service order for one or many devices.
- See real-time service order status.
- Ship to and receive Advance Exchange shipments in bulk if devices are covered by an extended warranty or if Advance Exchange was included in the device purchase.

When you add a Microsoft 365 tenant to the beta program, the following Admin roles are granted additional permissions:

| Role                  | Permissions                                                                                                                         |
