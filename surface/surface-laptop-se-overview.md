# Surface Laptop SE overview 

Surface Laptop SE is a classic clamshell form factor that delivers a secure, premium experience for students and easy deployment and management for IT at an affordable cost. It comes with Windows 11 SE, a cloud-first OS pre-loaded with widely used apps like Microsoft Teams, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, OneNote, Edge, Minecraft: Education Edition, and Flipgrid. Highlights include:

- Modern processor and eMMC storage to ensure everyday tasks load and run quickly, making opening apps and editing content a breeze.
- Immersive screen, audio, and video with a brilliant 11.6” display, front-facing 720p HD camera, digital mic, and stereo speakers.
- Long battery life so students can be confident in carrying Laptop SE to power creativity, ideas, and productivity throughout the school day.
- Get connected with USB-C and USB-A ports for connecting to displays and docking stations or charging accessories, plus a tried and true 3.5mm audio jack.
- An operating system made for education with Windows 11 SE, including accessibility features, full Office 365 experiences, and UI enhancements.
- Apps and policies pre-installed and preconfigured so you can enroll and go, saving time for IT during the deployment process.
- Protection from chip to cloud with Microsoft Endpoint Manager and DFCI, and management down to the firmware level with Windows Autopilot and Intune.
- Device safety with the Kensington Nano Security Slot™ to control physical access and simple and effective lid- lock to lock the operating system when the laptop is closed.

## Simplified deployment, management, and security

- Complete low-touch deployment for new devices using Windows Autopilot, easily applying policies and installing apps. Windows Autopilot provides low-touch deployment and imaging out of the box, with many apps and policies preinstalled and preconfigured. IT can easily adjust device settings—including firmware settings—and install the apps students need so that everything is ready to go when they first power on their device. 
- Once devices are deployed, Microsoft Intune delivers streamlined remote management throughout the school year, giving IT the ability to manage apps, control security and privacy, and generate compliance reports. 
- Lock the operating system with lid-lock when the laptop is closed, and control physical access with the integrated Kensington Nano Security Slot™.
- A newly designed non-exposed hinge, a plastic chassis, and a plastic boarder surrounding the screen that goes out to the bezel, makes Surface Laptop SE more durable than the standard Surface device to better meet the needs and demands of student use. 
- Microsoft Endpoint Manager and DFCI support secure device updates and management to the firmware layer. IT can control hardware elements such as mics, USB ports, cameras, and Bluetooth—and remove power to peripherals. The unique scannable Surface packaging allows easy identification of devices, with the device ID number staying the same when it comes time to re-enroll.
