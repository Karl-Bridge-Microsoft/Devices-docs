# Adjust Ease of Access settings on Surface Hub

Microsoft Surface Hub has a variety of Ease of Access options. New in Windows 10 Team 2020 Update 2:

- Users have direct access to accessibility settings during a Surface Hub session.
- Users can close apps on Surface Hub by selecting the close button, in the top right corner of the app, just like they do in other versions of Windows 10. This removes the need to close apps by dragging them to the bottom of the Surface Hub display. 

## Default accessibility settings

| Accessibility feature | Default settings  |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Magnifier             | Off               |
| High contrast         | No theme selected |
| Closed captions       | Defaults selected for Font and Background and window |
| Keyboard              | **On-screen Keyboard**, **Sticky Keys**, **Toggle Keys**, and **Filter Keys** are all off. |
| Mouse                 | Defaults selected for **Pointer size**, **Pointer color** and **Mouse keys**. |
| Other options         | Defaults selected for **Visual options** and **Touch feedback**. |

## Ease of access settings

During a Surface Hub session, users can adjust Ease of Access settings.

- Select **Start** > **Settings** > **Ease of Access**.

## Display

- Simplify and personalize Surface Hub.
- Minimize visual distractions by turning off animations.

By default, Surface Hub notifications disappear five seconds after they appear. If you want more time to read them, you can increase how long they're displayed.
