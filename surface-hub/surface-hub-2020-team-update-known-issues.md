| When using the Whiteboard Application on Surface Hub devices, the contents cannot be shared via email.             | When going through the Whiteboard export flow to email the contents of the Whiteboard Application, Surface Hub devices are currently displaying "Your device isn't set up for email.".  As a result, the Whiteboard contents cannot be shared via email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.

| Some Surface Hubs are experiencing connectivity issues to their Azure Log Analytics (formerly known as OMS) workspaces.                                                                        | For the Surface Hub devices affected, when using Azure Monitor, no data is reported to the workspace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.  Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Some Surface Hubs are restarting when a user selects 'End Session'.                                                                      | When Surface Hub device users select the 'End Session' functionality to clear user data, the Surface Hub device may erroneously detect a cleanup failure, forcing a restart of Windows to ensure clean up occurs successfully.                                                                                                                                                                      | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.  Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Some Surface Hubs may stop synchronizing their computer clock with time.windows.com if they have been [affiliated with Azure Active Directory or configured with no affiliation](prepare-your-environment-for-surface-hub.md#device-affiliation). When this synchronization is not working, time on the device may drift from the actual time.       | Clock drift beyond 5 minutes can cause authentication failures in standard Surface Hub scenarios including Teams sign-in.                                                                                                                                                                     | On the impacted device, go to **All Apps** > **Settings** > **Time & language** > **Date & time**, and toggle **Set time automatically** off, then back on.<br> <br>Microsoft is also actively investigating this issue and will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible.                             |
| In environments where proxy is configured as a manual server address, Teams calls & meetings cannot connect. | After the [Teams Room on Surface Hub client](surface-hub-teams-rooms.md) is installed in some environments, you may see "Sorry, we couldn't connect you" when attempting to join calls or meetings. | If possible, allow direct access to [Teams endpoints](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges). Otherwise, replace manual proxy server address with a setup script url (.pac file) to work around the issue.<br> <br>Microsoft is also actively investigating this issue and will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible. |
| Quality of Service (QoS) settings do not work as expected | After configuring QoS settings via MDM policy or provisioning package, DSCP markings are not being applied to Teams or Skype for Business (SfB) media traffic. | Microsoft is aware of and is actively investigating this issue.  Microsoft will provide additional information regarding a resolution as quickly as possible. |
| Calendar sync of hybrid device accounts with on-premises mailboxes fails.   | Surface Hub devices default to using Modern Authentication for accounts that exist in Azure AD, even if they have on-premises mailboxes that do not work with this feature. In this scenario, Exchange stops syncing meetings to the device. As a result, the device does not receive or display new meetings.                                                                                                    | After [KB4598291](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4598291) (or a subsequent Windows CU) is installed, the [SurfaceHub CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/surfacehub-csp) has a new ExchangeModernAuthEnabled parameter available to toggle the use of Modern Authentication. This can be set to false via MDM policy or [provisioning package](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/3/F/83FD5089-D14E-42E3-AF7C-6FC36F80D347/ExchangeModernAuthDisabled.ppkg) to prevent the Hub from using Modern Authentication.                                                                                                |
| A small subset of v1 Surface Hub devices are not able to automatically upgrade to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update.                                            | This small subset of v1 Surface Hub devices are in a state that is preventing compatibility with direct upgrade via Windows Update.                                                                                                                                          | Manually re-image the device to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update [using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool](surface-hub-recovery-tool.md).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Surface Hub displays "No bootable device" message after attempting to install the Windows 10 Team 2020 update.                                                                        | During the Windows Update process for Windows 10 Team 2020, some Hub v1 devices will go into an unbootable state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Manually re-image the device to the Windows 10 Team 2020 Update [using the Surface Hub Recovery Tool](surface-hub-recovery-tool.md).                                                                                                                                                          |

| Action Center has an unclickable Settings link. | This link should not appear in Windows 10 Team and may cause confusion.   | The functionality is the same as before the 2020 update; the  Apps section of the Start menu should be used to launch the Settings app.    |
